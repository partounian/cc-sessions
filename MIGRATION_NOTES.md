# Migration Notes: Consolidate to `/sessions` and Align With upstream/main

**Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

This PR introduces a unified slash-command surface (`/sessions`) and documents behavior diffs vs upstream/main, along with a removal/verification checklist for our environment.

## Scope

- Unify legacy slash commands under `/sessions` (state, config, tasks, kickstart).
- Keep DAIC enforcement, statusline UX, and protocols aligned with upstream/main.
- Capture explicit diffs for protocols, agents, and context-compaction.

## Environment Paths (exact)

- Current install (legacy commands):
  - `/Users/partounian/Documents/code/.claude/commands/`
- Local repo snapshot (this PR):
  - `/Users/partounian/Downloads/cc-sessions-git`
- Upstream worktree (read-only reference):
  - `../_worktrees/cc-sessions-main` (detached at upstream/main)

---

## Unified Slash Command: `/sessions`

Subcommands (align with upstream/main CHANGELOG):

- `/sessions state`
  - `show [--json]` – mode, task, todos, active protocol
  - `mode discussion|implementation` – DAIC switching (implementation guarded)
  - `todos`, `status`
- `/sessions config`
  - `phrases list|add|remove` – trigger phrases
  - `features show|toggle <key>` – feature flags (e.g., `use_nerd_fonts` or `icon_style`)
  - `read|write list|add|remove` – bash read/write patterns
  - `tools list|block <Tool>|unblock <Tool>` – tool blocking in discussion mode
- `/sessions tasks`
  - `list` (optionally `--open|--done`)
  - `start <task-file>` (mirrors natural triggers)
  - `complete <task-file>` (directory-task aware)
  - `idx` (if task indexes enabled)
- `/sessions kickstart`
  - `next`, `complete`

Legacy → unified mapping:

- `.claude/commands/add-trigger.md` → `/sessions config phrases add <category> "<phrase>"`
- `.claude/commands/api-mode.md` → use `/sessions state` and `/sessions config features toggle <key>`; define a feature if needed
- `.claude/commands/onboard.md` → `/sessions kickstart next|complete` (or natural triggers)
- `.claude/commands/analyze-repo.md` → no direct CLI in upstream; use agents during startup (context-gathering) or document as guidance

---

## Removal Checklist (exact paths)

Remove legacy slash-command files from the current install (kept out of VCS in this PR, listed for operator action):

- `/Users/partounian/Documents/code/.claude/commands/add-trigger.md`
- `/Users/partounian/Documents/code/.claude/commands/api-mode.md`
- `/Users/partounian/Documents/code/.claude/commands/onboard.md`
- `/Users/partounian/Documents/code/.claude/commands/analyze-repo.md` (optional)

If mirrored in this repo, remove equivalent legacy files from `cc_sessions/commands/` (none found; `sessions.md` already present).

---

## Verification Checklist (post-migration)

1. Command surface

- `/sessions config phrases list` then `add` and `remove` phrases → reflected in `sessions/sessions-config.json`.
- `/sessions config features show` and `toggle use_nerd_fonts` (or `icon_style` depending on chosen scheme).
- `/sessions config tools block Write` and `tools list` → Write blocked in discussion mode.
- `/sessions config read add jq` and `read list` → jq treated as read-only.

2. Tasks & protocols

- `/sessions tasks list` shows tasks; `start <task-file>` (parent README.md for directory task) loads startup protocol; subtask startup respects parent branch.
- `complete <task-file>` prevents merge for directory subtasks; merges only at parent completion.

3. DAIC read-only enforcement (discussion mode)

- Allowed: `cat README.md`
- Blocked: `sed -i ...`, `awk '... > "out"'`, `find . -delete`, `find . -exec rm {}`+, `printf a | xargs rm`

4. Statusline UX

- Shows branch; upstream tracking `↑N`/`↓N`; detached HEAD marker; Nerd Fonts icons if enabled.

## Diff-based Notes: Protocols, Agents, Context-Compaction

### Protocols

- Kickstart (upstream/main) explicitly demonstrates blocked Bash writes in discussion mode (e.g., `echo >`, `sed -i`, `find -delete`).
- Adds an “agents-only” kickstart fast path (not present locally by default).
- Minor copy edits to emphasize Q&A before proceeding and reduce noise.

### Agents (docs)

- `context-gathering` – aggressive discovery; task-file-only edits.
- `context-refinement` – updates Context Manifest only on drift/new discoveries; reads transcripts from `sessions/transcripts/context-refinement/`.
- `logging` – consolidates Work Log during compaction/completion; enforces strict chronological order.
- `service-documentation` – upstream/main expands guidance for super-repo/mono-repo/module patterns; local doc is leaner; adopt one or merge.

### Context-Compaction

- Trigger phrases (`squish`, `lets compact`) → compaction protocol orchestrates:
  - logging agent (normalize Work Log; update Success Criteria/Next Steps)
  - context-refinement agent (append Context Manifest updates only when needed)
  - optional code-review agent (pre-commit quality)
- Transcripts read from agent-specific directories to ensure accurate, chronological consolidation and deduplication.

## Behavior Diffs vs upstream/main (headlines)

- DAIC enforcement: Both local and upstream/main block sed/awk/find/xargs write-like operations; read-only commands allowed.
- Statusline: Upstream counters present in upstream/main; local also supports them. Choose the icon preference scheme: `icon_style` (upstream/main) or `use_nerd_fonts` (local); keep one consistently.
- Tasks-dir policy: upstream/main does not include `WORKSPACE_ROOT`; only `PROJECT_ROOT`-based paths are used. If needed, keep your local workspace policy behind a feature flag and document it.
- Tests: current upstream/main commit includes no `tests/` directory; do not rely on automated tests for acceptance in this PR.

---

## Quick Evidence (spot checks)

- DAIC matrix (upstream/main worktree; discussion mode):
  - `cat README.md` → allowed (EC:0)
  - `sed -i` / `awk ... >` / `find -delete` / `find -exec rm` / `xargs rm` → blocked (EC:2)
- Statusline (upstream/main) shows upstream tracking via:
  - `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD` and `HEAD..@{u}`

---

## Follow-ups (optional, out-of-scope for this PR)

- Decide on `icon_style` vs `use_nerd_fonts` and converge on a single feature.
- If you need super-repo workspace behavior, formalize `WORKSPACE_ROOT` as a feature with clear docs.
- Consider adding a minimal test harness for DAIC enforcement and statusline in this repo to prevent regressions.

## Implementation Summary (Completed)

### Icon Style Migration (`use_nerd_fonts` → `icon_style`)

- ✅ Updated `EnabledFeatures` dataclass in both Python and JavaScript
- ✅ Automatic migration logic: `use_nerd_fonts=True` → `icon_style="nerd-fonts"`, `False` → `"ascii"`
- ✅ All statusline icon logic updated to support 3 modes (nerd-fonts, unicode, ascii)
- ✅ Config commands updated: `features set icon_style <value>` with validation
- ✅ Helpful error message for invalid toggle attempts

### Workspace Mode Feature

- ✅ Added `workspace_mode` boolean to EnabledFeatures (default: false)
- ✅ Integrated into config features toggle system
- ✅ Note: Task path logic guards can be added when WORKSPACE_ROOT is actually needed

### Service Documentation Agent

- ✅ Replaced with upstream version from cc-sessions-main worktree
- ✅ Expanded guidance for super-repo, mono-repo, and module patterns

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Created `tests/test_icon_style.py` - Config migration and statusline tests
- ✅ Expanded `tests/test_daic_enforcement.py` - 13 new DAIC matrix tests
- ✅ Created `tests/test_sessions_commands.py` - Command surface integration tests
- ✅ Created `tests/test_workspace_mode.py` - Feature toggle tests
- ✅ Manual testing confirms all icon_style operations work correctly

### Documentation

- ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated with breaking changes and migration notes
- ✅ Version bumped to v0.4.0 (unreleased)
- ✅ Deprecation notices for `use_nerd_fonts`
