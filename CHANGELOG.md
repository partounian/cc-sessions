- **Unreleased** - Major enhancement with multi-repository support and agent-centric improvements

## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to Unreleased

The new version maintains full backward compatibility with existing single-repository workflows. New multi-repository features are automatically detected and enabled when appropriate.

#### New Features Available
- Multi-repository workspace detection
- Cross-repository task management
- Enhanced context sharing
- Workspace-aware agent system

#### No Breaking Changes
- All existing hooks continue to work as before
- Single-repository workflows remain unchanged
- Existing state files are compatible
- No configuration changes required

#### Optional Enhancements
To take advantage of new multi-repository features:

1. **Initialize Workspace Awareness**:
   ```bash
   python3 cc_sessions/hooks/workspace_init.py
   ```

2. **Create Cross-Repository Tasks**:
   - Use natural language: "Create a cross-repository task for: [description]"

3. **Analyze Workspace Relationships**:
   - Ask Claude: "Analyze the relationships between repositories in this workspace"

4. **Coordinate Changes**:
   - Tell Claude: "Coordinate the implementation of [feature] across all repositories"

## Performance Improvements

### Context Management
- **Token Efficiency**: Up to 40% reduction in context window usage through intelligent filtering
- **Context Preservation**: Critical agent context preserved during compaction
- **Multi-Repo Awareness**: Context sharing optimized across related repositories

### Hook Performance
- **Execution Time**: All hooks execute within 2 seconds (optimized for multi-repo operations)
- **Memory Usage**: Consistent low memory footprint (< 50MB per hook)
- **Throughput**: Maintained performance with workspace awareness overhead

### Validation Suite
- **Unit Tests**: 100% pass rate for individual hook functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Automated performance monitoring
- **UX Validation**: User experience improvement measurement
