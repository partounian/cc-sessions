# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Repository detection** – improved algorithm (depth 1, max 10 repos, cache-directory exclusions, optional include/exclude lists).
- **SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit** – now emit human-readable text wrapped in simple tags instead of JSON blobs.
- **DAIC workflow** – `workflow-manager.py` allows edits to `.claude/state/current_task.json` while still blocking code edits during discussion mode.
- **Hook exit-codes** – audited: hooks consistently use 0 (success), 1 (fatal), 2 (per-tool block) as per Claude Code spec.
- **Settings** – duplicate/legacy hook registrations removed; only consolidated hooks remain.

### Removed

- Legacy `session-start.py` and other orphan/backup hook files.
- Root-level analysis docs superseded by README / CHANGELOG.

_No breaking changes._

### Validation Suite

- **Unit Tests**: 100% pass rate for individual hook functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Automated performance monitoring
- **UX Validation**: User experience improvement measurement
